# ðŸ‘œ Making a Kryptokrona Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for Kryptokrona, paper wallet, CLI wallet and GUI wallet.

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

To view a guide on how to make a paper wallet, you can go [here](../../docs/guides/Making-a-paper-wallet/).

## xkr-wallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called xkr-wallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

You can find a guide on how to use xkr-wallet [here](Making-a-Wallet.md#xkr-wallet-cli-wallet).

## Kryptokrona Wallet (GUI Wallet)

Kryptokrona also has a GUI wallet, It's open sourced and available on every major OS. You can download it [here](https://kryptokrona.se/en/kryptokrona-wallet-2/), or view the source code [here](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-wallet)

If you would like to use it, you can check out [this guide](../../docs/guides/Using-Remote-Nodes/#proton-wallet).

## Android wallet

You can also use your Android phone to store your XKR funds in. You can find it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xkr).
